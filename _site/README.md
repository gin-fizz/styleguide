# Styleguide

This is the living styleguide for pollistics.

## Adding new components

All components are defined in `_components/name.md`. There you write a summary, syntax and examples.

Style is defined in `_sass/components/name.scss`.

:warning: also edit `_sass/__components__.scss` to include new files.

## Using the components

[TODO] how to link src/main.css into another site (maybe via npm???)
